# Stock Portfolio Manager

## Overview

The **Stock Portfolio Manager** is a full-featured application that allows users to manage their stock investments. Users can view their stock portfolio, buy and sell stocks, and search for specific stocks using the **yt.finance** library for real-time data. This application offers a user-friendly interface built with React and a backend powered by Python.

## Features

- **Portfolio Management**: View and manage your stock portfolio.
- **Buy/Sell Stocks**: Easily buy and sell stocks with real-time updates.
- **Stock Search**: Search for specific stocks to check availability and details.
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and loading states for better UX.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask or Django recommended)
- **Stock Data API**: `yt.finance` library for fetching stock data
- **Styling**: Inline CSS or CSS modules (your choice)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-portfolio-manager.git
   cd stock-portfolio-manager
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   Navigate to the backend directory and install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py  # or the specific command to start your backend
   ```

5. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

- Use the "View Portfolio" button to fetch and display your current stock holdings.
- Search for stocks by entering the stock ticker symbol.
- Use the provided options to buy or sell stocks directly from your portfolio.

## Backend Structure

- The backend is built using Python and communicates with the frontend via RESTful API.
- The `yt.finance` library is utilized to fetch real-time stock data for search and portfolio management.
- Ensure your backend server is running and accessible for the frontend to function correctly.

## Future Improvements

- Implement user authentication for secure stock trading.
- Expand error handling to cover more edge cases.
- Introduce data visualization tools for better portfolio insights.
- Create a dashboard for comprehensive market trends and personal investment analytics.
- Transition to TypeScript for enhanced type safety in the frontend.
